        <p>I'm Carmela Sunga, a third-year Computer Engineering student from the University of the Assumption. My hobbies include sleeping, and my favorite music is 
        "Que Sera, Sera" by Jay Livingston and Ray Evans. When it comes to comfort food, I absolutely love ice cream</p>
        <p>I chose Computer Engineering not only due to its family-centered nature but also because of my deep-rooted desire to comprehend its inner workings. My journey has been incredibly exhilarating, and I am eagerly

        while also considering how I can apply my knowledge to real-world knowledge</p>
